# NY-Property-Tax-Record-Fraud-Detection
This project analyzes New York City’s (NYC’s) real estate data to specifically identify property tax fraud. The main indicators of property tax fraud were property tax assessments that were too high or too low. Given a property dataset of 1,070,994 records and 32 data fields, we first described, visualized, and filled in missing values for each variable. Second, 45 additional variables were created in order to create the most accurate algorithm. Next, we used dimensionality reduction techniques to refine our dataset. Finally, we used (principal component analysis (PCA) and an autoencoder) to obtain two separate fraud scores. The scores were combined and then ranked to get a final fraud score.
